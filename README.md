# Blink SEO Shopify developement wrapper

This is a development wrapper intended for working with Shopify themes, using the [Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/themes/tools/cli).

## Dependencies

To work with Shopify stores using this wrapper make sure to have the following installed

- [Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/themes/tools/cli/getting-started)
- [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
## Getting Started

Start by running npm install to set up the development dependencies you'll need.

```bash
npm install
```

## Connecting to Shopify

### Whoami

It's generally a good idea to check who you are logged in as before you start any work.

```bash
shopify whoami
```

Will output the store you are currently logged into and who you are logged in as. The output might look something like:

```bash
Logged into store blink-developer.myshopify.com in partner organization Blink
```

### Log into a store

Log into the store you want to work on with the `shopify login --store <SUBDOMAIN>.myshopify.com` command. Where the subdomain is the subdomain name of your store e.g.

```bash
shopify login --store blink-developer.myshopify.com
```

This will take you to an auth page in your browser. Use that to log into your account.

## Downloading a theme and working locally

Download an existing theme to your local machine using:

```bash
shopify theme pull
```

This will list out the themes currently on the store. Use your terminal to select the one you want to work on.

Once your theme has downloaded you can run:

```bash
shopify theme serve
```

to generate the following:

- A link to your development theme at http://127.0.0.1:9292. This URL can hot reload local changes to CSS and sections, or refresh the entire page when a file changes, allowing you to preview changes in real time using the store's data.
- A link to the online store editor for the theme.
- A preview link that you can share with other developers.

## Pushing your changes

Upload your local theme files to Shopify, overwriting the remote theme if specified.

```bash
shopify theme push
```
